      <h1>How Does react work?</h1>
      <p>Ans:React is a JavaScript library (not a framework) that creates user interfaces (UIs) in a predictable and efficient way using declarative code.The world can't live without mobile and web applications in this day and age. Everything is digitized, from booking cabs to ordering food to make bank transactions. Thanks to the efficient frameworks that provide a seamless user experience. One such robust frontend library is React. </p>

      <h1>How useState work?</h1>
      <p>Ans:You pass the initial state to this function and it returns a variable with the current state value and another function to update this value.The useState is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. React has two types of components, one is class components which are ES6 classes that extend from React and the other is functional components.</p>
